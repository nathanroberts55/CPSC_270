 * <h1>Asg3: Binary Search Tree</h1>
 * <h2>Objectives</h2>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>develop/improve your ability to implement a BinSearchTreeADT given its
 * ADT</li>
 * <li>develop/improve your ability to write JUnit tests</li>
 * <li>develop/improve your ability to write readable code according to best
 * practices</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <h2>Introduction</h2>
 * <p>
 * The BinSearchTreeADT defines the API for a Binary Search Tree. Note that a
 * newly created BinSearchTreeADT is empty.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Description</h3>
 * <p>
 * A BinSearchTreeADT is a Binary Search Tree of Character.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Fluent Programming Style</h3>
 * <p>
 * Note that there are no void methods here. Methods that would normally be void
 * return the this Object so that method calls can be chained. For example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Suppose SetADT foo = new SetImplementation();
 * Then foo.add("a").add("b"); produces the same result as
 * foo.add("a");
 * foo.add("b");
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Your task is to implement this ADT, develop a JUnit test class, and document
 * both using Javadoc. You will need to implement a Binary Search Tree Node as
 * shown in section 7.8.1 of the book. Use the same Class definition for leaves
 * and internal nodes.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Instructions</h2>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Study the code in Chapter 7, especially 7.11 of-the textbook.</li>
 * <li>Your implementation should store Characters.</li>
 * <li>Your implementation should NOT use generics.</li>
 * <li>Write the Javadoc for the JUnit class and the implementation.</li>
 * <li>Write the JUnit tests for the ADT described by this API.</li>
 * <li>Implement, using pointers, NOT ARRAYS, the ADT described by this
 * API.</li>
 * <li>You may NOT use any pre-existing classes that defeat the purposes of this
 * assignment (ex. List, ArrayList, etc.)</li>
 * <li>Submit your files to Web-CAT using the eclipse menu "Project->Submit
 * Assignment..."</li>
 * <li>To see my comments after I've graded your work, or to see your results at
 * any time, login to http://web-cat.cs.vt.edu</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
 * <p>
 * Develop preliminary JUnit tests before you implement the methods, using the
 * process described in class and the slides. For example, develop tests for a
 * method, implement the method, run the tests. Do this until the method passes
 * the tests. Go on to the next method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Sometimes you may have to implement a little bit as well in order to write
 * your JUnit tests. The process involves switching between JUnit tests and
 * implementation, in order to develop a good understanding of the problems to
 * be solved.
 * </p>
 * </p>
 * <h2>NOTES</h2>
 * <p>
 * <li>Any submission that does not use pointers as described in the book and in
 * class will receive NO CREDIT.</li>
 * <li>Any submission that that uses pre-existing classes like ArrayList will
 * receive NO CREDIT.</li>
 * <li>You may submit as many times as you like until the deadline.</li>
 * <li>The grade of your latest submission will be the one recorded.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
