 * <h1>Asg1: Recursion</h1>
 * <p>
 * This API defines the ParserADT. It provides methods to parse a given String
 * and calculate some Mathematical functions.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Objectives</h2>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>practice writing recursive methods</li>
 * <li>practice developing JUnit tests</li>
 * <li>use Web-CAT to learn how to develop correct implementations and effective
 * tests</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <h2>Introduction</h2>
 * <p>
 * The class ParserADT defines the API for a utility package for parsing
 * expressions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Your task is to implement this ADT, develop a JUnit test class, and document
 * both using Javadoc. You MUST use recursion for all the methods described
 * below (except for the Constructor).
 * </p>
 * <h2>Instructions</h2>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Write the Javadoc for the JUnit class and the implementation.</li>
 * <li>Write the JUnit tests for the ADT described by this API.</li>
 * <li>Implement the ADT described by this API.</li>
 * <li>Submit to Web-CAT using the eclipse menu "Project->Submit
 * Assignment..."</li>
 * <li>To see my comments after I've graded your work, or to see your results at
 * any time, login to http://web-cat.cs.vt.edu</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
 * <p>
 * Develop preliminary JUnit tests before you implement the methods, using the
 * process described in class and the slides. For example, develop tests for a
 * method, implement the method, run the tests. Do this until the method passes
 * the tests. Go on to the next method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Sometimes you may have to implement a little bit as well in order to write
 * your JUnit tests. The process involves switching between JUnit tests and
 * implementation, in order to develop a good understanding of the problems to
 * be solved.
 * </p>
 * </p>
 * <h2>NOTES</h2>
 * <p>
 * <li>You may submit as many times as you like until the deadline.</li>
 * <li>The grade of your latest submission will be the one recorded.</li>
 * <li><b>Disregard the Web-CAT correctness grade. I will compute it
 * differently.</b></li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <h2>CHECKLIST</h2>
 * <p>
 * Check that you have done all the following.
 * <ul>
 * <li>The implementing class for this assignment is named RecursiveParser</li>
 * <li>All methods specified in the ADT are implemented.</li>
 * <li>Any non-ADT methods are declared PRIVATE.</li>
 * <li>Fields, if any, are declared private.</li>
 * <li>Code is formatted as described in piazza</li>
 * <li>Javadoc is present in the implementation and JUnit class headers as well
 * as all non-private fields and ALL methods, as described in piazza</li>
 * <li>You read and followed these how-to items in piazza:
 * <ul>
 * <li>write JUnit tests</li>
 * <li>write and format readable Java (and satisfy Web-CAT's format checks)</li>
 * <li>video: setup eclipse to format your code for Web-CAT</li>
 * <li>setup Eclipse for Web-CAT</li>
 * <li>submit your assignment to Web-CAT from within Eclipse</li>
 * <li>find formatting or code coverage errors in my source code</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
